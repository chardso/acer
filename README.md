been looking for reasons why our communities in africa and other parts of the globe are not developing, but after serious analysis over some period of time, i discovered the following;
- A number of the people believe age is a limitting factor to learning.
- A certain percentage of the skilled people are selfish over sharing knowledge

- Monentary values are put as the first priority to accord skills to the communities, i volunteer to become a change maker to these communities, however the global communities which values what i am doing , and are in position to support, the activities, through funding, tools, and gadgets such as computers, cameras etc are welcome
